# Brute-Forcing Creativity

I'm exhausted. 

A couple years ago, I was trying to do figure out what to do with my life. 

Around this time, Dall-E came out and I was instantly hooked. It made no sense but I knew that this was how I needed to spend my life.

And that's what I've done for the past 3 years. 3 years of manically moving from one level of obsession to another. 

As I started to create art, a goal slowly began to materialise: to create tools that felt like how it feels to paint with intention, tools powered by AI that capture something of the process that is behind all the art we love. 

This lead me to deeper places, towards understanding how the models work, towards Comfy, towards building the Banodoco communtiy. 

Lately, I was reflecting on Dough, a tool that i made last week.

Together with help from Piyush, I spent the better more than 6 months building it.

I'm not one of those geniuses who can just pick up a new skill overnight. I'm at least half idiot. This six months was a brutal struggle for me. 

My direction with Dough was correct - the Animatediff ecosytem had so many amazing things in it and bringing that to the artists in an acccessible way was a good idea. 

However, its execution was bad - mostly due to the my lack of skill and my lack of resources. 

While there were good ideas behind it, they weren't implemented well, nor did I make the capabilities accessible to people. Over a year of my life was effectively squandered as I burnt through all of my savings.

At that point, it would've been sensible for me to give up. While I do believe that I've done some things that have been beneficial to others, I've also objectively made very little material progress towards my goal.

But I kept going. Beyond sense, beyond logic. 

After more obsessive sprinting in different directions, I started to build *another* tool - this time, called Reigh (get it?). After months more of work, it's close to ready. 

I know that the next thing I need to do is create stuff with it that inspires others who in turn create stuff. But I'm exhausted. At least right now. But it's also 4am on a Wednesday.

So consider this my attempt to brute-force bootstrapping creative expression. And to keep myself somewhat accountable. 

I mean, you are reading this...right? And now you're expecting me to create stuff...right?
