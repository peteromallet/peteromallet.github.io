# 5 Artworks made with Dough that touched me

As covered before, my previous tool - [Dough](https://github.com/banodoco/Dough) - was a massive failure. Despite this, some beautiful work was made with it.

Below are 5 pieces made with Dough that touched me:

# History of Architecture by @fabdream

Fabdream manages to capture the awe and excitement in what can often be abstract and difficult to grasp concepts.

He brings them to life in such a way that it grabs the attention of people and, based on the comments, really make them feel something.

He did that for me and many more with his History of Architecture:

# THESE PLACES THAT DON'T EXIST - @byArloo

I'm extremely interested in audio-visual poetry as a medium and Arlo was one of the first other than me to attempt this with Dough.

I don't know what this means, but he told me that he doesn't know what it means either:

# 'It Starts Now' by @HannahSubmarine

Hannah is my wife, so I'm a bit biased, but this was her first video made with AI and the first made with Dough.

During most of my time making Dough, I was constantly thinking of Hannah and how she would understand everything.

Seeing her make something so distinctly her made me feel like I had spent my time well.

# Every Day Is Halloween by @Teslanaut

A good music video pulls you not into a song but helps etch it in your brain. Coming up to Halloween, I find myself thinking of this song and video frequently thanks to Teslanaut:

# The Sound of the Tires in the Snow by @POM

Yes, I can put my own stuff here. 

Every year for the past 3 years, I make a video for a poem I love: Nirvana by Charles Bukowski. 

Making it involved so much suffering and sleep deprivation that I couldn't edit it for over a month after initially completing the first version. 

Then, when I came back to edit it, I watched it through and it hit me with the feeling I intended it to give: nostalgia for a life that you've never experienced. It was another one of those things that made me feel like I'm not wasting my life.

Claude tells me I should end on an authentic reflection but I have nothing else to say for now.
